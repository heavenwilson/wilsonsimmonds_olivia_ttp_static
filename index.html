    <h1>Olivia Wilson-Simmonds </h1>

  <p>My favorite hobby is drawing. I’ve loved art ever since I was a kid, when I would spend hours sketching fantasy creatures and colorful scenes in my notebooks. Drawing allows me to express myself in ways words sometimes can’t. Whether I’m illustrating detailed characters or dreamy landscapes, there’s always a story in my lines and colors.</p>
  <p>I have a cat named mija, who is a shorthaired american</p>
  <h2>Why I Love Drawing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It helps me relax and clear my mind</li>
    <li>It’s a creative outlet for storytelling</li>
    <li>I enjoy developing my own comic strips and characters</li>
    <li>It connects me with other artists online</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Favorite Tools</h2>
  <p>I mostly work digitally using tools like Krita and Clip Studio Paint, but I also enjoy traditional media like pencils and markers. Each has its own feel and personality.</p>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>One of my goals is to run a TTRPG Store with commissoned art peices. I’m always practicing, learning new techniques, and exploring different styles to grow as an artist.</p>
